The different behavior of the real plant and its mathematical description is a relatively well-known issue in the field of automation. It is a serious problem, especially in a situation where we try to ensure optimal operation of the plant. Many scientific publications address this issue, but the solutions they offer are often very complicated to implement or lead to uncertain results. This work brings a new approach to plant real-time optimization which is based on hybrid modeling using the guaranteed parameter estimation method. We decided to demonstrate the functionality of this method on a plant that is represented by a chemostat. The reason is that it includes many problems with modeling due to the presence of living organisms. The results of experiments showed that hybrid models can be used for operation optimization of the plant but an iterative approach can only get us to the optimum immediate surroundings, depending on the noise level. Unlike the other methods, the convergence of hybrid models is significantly faster and less sensitive to measurement noise, which is a great advantage for processes with large time constants.
